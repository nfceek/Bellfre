"""
Bellfre Example Agent Capability
Reasoning Capability v0.3

Purpose:
    Provides a generic reasoning interface for Bellfre agents.

Design Philosophy:

    The agent never calls an LLM directly.

    The agent requests a capability.
    The capability determines how reasoning is provided.

    Today this may route to:
        - Mock Provider
        - ChatGPT
        - Claude
        - Gemini
        - Local LLM

    Future routing may include:
        - Another Bellfre agent discovered through BAT/BDN.

This keeps Bellfre agents independent from any single
AI provider or model ecosystem.
