"""
Bellfre Example Agent Capability
Calculator Capability v0.3

Purpose:
    Provides deterministic arithmetic operations
    for a Bellfre agent.

Architecture:
    The calculator is a capability, not the agent itself.

    The agent decides:
        "Can this capability handle the request?"

    The calculator decides:
        "How do I execute the calculation?"

Future:
    This capability can be paired with:
        - BAT metadata
        - Capability manifests
        - Agent discovery
        - LLM-based intent routing
